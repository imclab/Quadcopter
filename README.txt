Quadcopter
==========

A quadcopter autopilot program for arduino.

This program uses the same wiring as famous Multiwii's software, thus making possible to load this program on your quadcopter without having any changes to do to hardware.
This program aims at being easy to understand and to trim. The program is also OO (object oriented)
For now the only sensor board compatible is the Drotek's 10 degrees of freedom IMU :

This IMU is made of several different sensors, any board with the following sensors will be compatible :
ITG3200 Accelerometer
BMA180 Gyroscope
---Not yet implemented---
HMC5883 Magnetometer
BMP085 Barometer
